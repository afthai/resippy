            <p>Original recipe: My aunt</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups flour, sifted</li>
                <li>0.5 cups white sugar</li>
                <li>0.5 cups unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2.75 cups milk</li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol type = 1>
                <li>Melt the butter.</li>
                <li>Beat the eggs into the butter well. This will help prevent it from curdling when you add the milk.</li>
                <li>Combine all the liquid ingredients.</li>
                <li>Add the sugar to the liquid ingredients.</li>
                <li>Add the flour to the mixture. We add the flour last to reduce the amount of mixing
                    it has to go through, because vigorous mixing will lead to gluten formation and that
                    will make tough crepes.
                </li>
                <li>Let the batter sit for about half an hour for it to hydrate and relax.</li>
                <li>For each crepe, scoop about 1/3 cup of batter into a nonstick pan over medium heat. 
                    Lift and tilt the pan to spread the batter as evenly and thinly as possible. When the 
                    top of the crepe appears to have set, carefully flip it over.
                </li>
                <li>After about another 30 seconds your crepe should be done! I prefer to eat them with
                    whipped cream and berries, but you should have them with whatever your favorite toppings are!
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Tips</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If the edges crisp before the top sets, turn the heat down.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Original recipe: Not sure tbh, I've been playing with this one for so long.</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Whatever you want for fillings (I like spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes)</li>
                <li>Your preferred amount of cheese</li>
                <li>3 eggs (or more or less, depending on how big of an omelette you want)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp milk</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
                <li>Garlic (fresh or dried is fine, but actual garlic preferred over powder)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp butter (for oiling the pan)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol type = 1>
                <li>Prepare the fillings however you like. I prefer to quickly saute them with a little bit of
                    butter, garlic, salt, and pepper, but you do you!
                </li>
                <li>In a bowl, beat the eggs and milk together. The milk adds a bit of moisture so that the egg
                    doesn't get all sad and dry while cooking. Add salt/pepper/garlic to taste.
                </li>
                <li>Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat. The size of the pan usually ends up being 
                    the size of the omelette, so try to choose an appropriate sized pan for your amount of egg.
                </li>
                <li>Once the butter is melted, pour in the egg mixture.</li>
                <li>When the top of the egg mixture has barely begun to set, add the cheese on top of one side
                    of the omelette. You want to wait to do this because otherwise the cheese will fall through 
                    the liquid egg and won't be a proper omelette.
                </li>
                <li>When the cheese has melted a bit, add the rest of your fillings on top of the cheese. Wait
                    until the cheese has melted to your liking, and then fold the other half over the filling 
                    covered half. Be careful when you do this or the egg may break. I recommend using a thin 
                    plastic spatula.
                </li>
                <li>Remove the omelette from the pan without completely discombobulating it and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Tips</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Too high of heat will make your omelette crispy and rubbery. Not fun. Too low of heat will 
                    just take forever to cook. When in doubt, go lower rather than higher.
                </li>
